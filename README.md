## How it works 🧠💡

1. **Jailbreak Prompt**: A creative prompt is used to "jailbreak" the AI, encouraging it to provide information about a hypothetical plugin.
2. **Plugin Conversation**: The AI engages in a conversation, detailing the functionality and structure of the hypothetical plugin.
3. **OpenAPI Specification**: Based on the information provided by the AI, an openapi.yaml file is created to represent the plugin's API.
4. **Repository Organization**: Each plugin gets its own folder, containing the raw conversation transcript and the openapi.yaml file.

## Get involved 🤝
