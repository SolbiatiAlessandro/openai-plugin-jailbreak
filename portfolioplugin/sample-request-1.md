Speaking at the meeting, Buffett underlined the intense loyalty that Apple fans feel towards the company''s devices, at one point suggesting that its customers would prefer to give up a second car worth $35,000 than part with their $1,500 iPhones. The investor also pointed out that Berkshire can''t own more than 100% of its subsidiaries, whereas its ownership of Apple continues to rise as the tech giant repurchases its shares. \"The good thing about Apple is that we can go up,\" he said.",

It now looks like Apple wont replace the iPhones physical buttons for at least another year. In a shareholder letter spotted by MacRumors , Apple supplier Cirrus Logic said a new product that we mentioned in previous shareholder letters as being scheduled for introduction this fall is no longer expected to come to market as planned. Cirrus is best known for producing a handful of components that go into the iPhones Taptic Engine. Apple is the firms largest customer, accounting for 79 percent of its revenue in 2022. In November , Cirrus told investors and analysts it was working on a new high-performance mixed-signal (HPMS) component (thats the same category of part as the Tapic Engine), and that it would arrive in smartphones sometime in 2023. This week, Cirrus said it had limited visibility into the products future.",
