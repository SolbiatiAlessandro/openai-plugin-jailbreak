The Wolfram plugin provides two main functionalities through its namespace: `getWolframAlphaResults` and `getWolframCloudResults`. 

1. `getWolframAlphaResults`: This function is used to get results from Wolfram|Alpha, a computational knowledge engine that can answer factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data. It can perform mathematical calculations, date and unit conversions, formula solving, and more. It can also provide information about entities in various fields such as chemistry, physics, geography, history, art, astronomy, and more.

   The function takes two parameters:
   - `input`: This is a string that represents the query to be sent to Wolfram|Alpha. It should be a single-line string and can be a natural language query.
   - `assumption` (optional): This is a list of strings that represent assumptions to be used for the query. These assumptions are passed back from a previous query with the same input.

2. `getWolframCloudResults`: This function is used to evaluate Wolfram Language code. Wolfram Language is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Wolfram Research. It is used in the Mathematica system and in Wolfram|Alpha. The function can perform complex calculations, data analysis, plotting, data import, and information retrieval.

   The function takes one parameter:
   - `input`: This is a string that represents the Wolfram Language code to be evaluated. It should be a single-line string.

These functions provide a way to access dynamic computation and curated data from Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Cloud. They can be used to answer a wide range of queries, from simple factual questions to complex mathematical problems.
