The edX plugin is designed to incorporate information, advice, and guidance on academic topics into ChatGPT conversations using the edX course library and course content. The plugin is organized into a namespace called "edX" and contains four type definitions: `searchCourses`, `searchLessons`, `searchVideos`, and `searchQuizzes`.

Here's a detailed explanation of each type definition and their fields:

1. `searchCourses`: This type is used to return a list of relevant edX courses matching the current conversation context.

    - `query`: This field is used to submit up to ten keywords for identifying the most relevant edX courses to the conversation context. The more specific the keywords, the more pertinent the edX courses identified for the conversation will be.

2. `searchLessons`: This type is used to get a list of educational lessons from relevant edX courses.

    - `query`: This field is used to search for educational lessons from edX courses with keywords. The keywords should be specific to the topic of interest to get the most relevant lessons.

3. `searchVideos`: This type is used to get a list of educational videos from relevant edX courses.

    - `query`: This field is used to search for educational videos from relevant edX courses with keywords. The keywords should be specific to the topic of interest to get the most relevant videos.

4. `searchQuizzes`: This type is used to get a list of quizzes from relevant edX courses that can be used to help users deepen their understanding of related topics.

    - `query`: This field is used to search for quizzes from inside edX courses using keywords. The keywords should be specific to the topic of interest to get the most relevant quizzes.

Each of these types takes in a JSON object with a `query` field. The `query` field is a string that should contain keywords related to the educational content you're interested in. The plugin uses these keywords to search the edX course library and return relevant content.

Please note that as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the actual implementation details, such as how the search is performed or how the results are ranked, are not publicly available. The information provided here is based on the namespace and type definitions provided.
