The `speechki_tts_plugin` namespace is designed to interact with the Speechki platform, which provides advanced text-to-speech services. It has two type definitions:

1. `get__speakers`: This type doesn't take any input parameters and is designed to return a list of available artificial voices for text-to-speech conversion. The returned information includes details about each voice, such as the voice ID, speaker's name, language, gender, and narration style. This endpoint helps users to select the most suitable voice for their ChatGPT-generated content.

2. `tts`: This type takes two optional parameters: `speaker_id` and `text`. 

   - `speaker_id` is a unique identifier representing a specific artificial voice provided by the Speechki platform. 
   
   - `text` is the input text, either provided by the user or generated by ChatGPT, which is sent to the Speechki platform for conversion into a high-quality audio file using advanced text-to-speech services.

In summary, the `speechki_tts_plugin` namespace is used to convert text into speech using the Speechki platform. It provides functionality to retrieve information about available voices (`get__speakers`) and to convert specific text into speech (`tts`).
