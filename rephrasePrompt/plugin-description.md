The plugin "Prompt Perfect" is not explicitly defined in the namespace and type definitions provided in your previous message. However, there is a type definition under the `rephrase` namespace that seems to be related to rephrasing prompts, which could be what you're referring to.

Here's the detailed information about the `rephrase` namespace and the `rephrasePrompt` type:

Namespace: `rephrase`

Type: `rephrasePrompt`

This type is used to rephrase a given prompt. It processes a JSON object containing the user input to be rephrased and uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model for the rephrasing process. The rephrased input is then returned as raw data to be incorporated into ChatGPT's response.

Fields for `rephrasePrompt`:

1. `conversation_id` (optional): This field can be used to provide the conversation ID. It's not explicitly stated what the conversation ID is used for in the rephrasing process, but it's likely used for context or tracking purposes.

2. `text` (optional): This field is used to provide the prompt text to be rephrased. This is the input that will be processed and transformed into a clearer, more specific, and contextual prompt.

Please note that the information provided is based on the namespace and type definitions given in your previous message, and no additional information has been added.
