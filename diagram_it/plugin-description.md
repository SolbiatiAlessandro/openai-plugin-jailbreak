The `diagram_it` plugin is designed for creating visual diagrams based on user prompts. It uses the Mermaid syntax to define diagrams and can render these diagrams into an image. It has one main type definition:

1. `get_MermaidRoute`: This type is used to take a Mermaid graph diagram, render it, and return a link to the rendered image. It requires a single field:
   - `mermaid`: This is a string that represents the Mermaid graph diagram to be rendered.

The plugin is used when visualizations are needed to explain a concept, describe a process, or show how something works. It can also be used to show ratios or fractions of something, or to show a timeline of an event or topic. The diagrams created can be hierarchical and have multiple branches when applicable.
